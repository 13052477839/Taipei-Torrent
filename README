Taipei Torrent

This is a simple Bittorrent client coded in the go programming language.

FAQ:

Q: Why call it Taipei Torrent?
A: I started writing it while visiting Taipei, Taiwan

Q: What is the license?

A: The code in the bencode subdirectory is controlled by the LICENSE file in that
directory.

The code in the http subdirectory is controlled by the standard Go Authors license.

The code in the rest of Taipei Torrent is controlled by the LICENSE file in the
top level.

Q: Why do you have your own copy of the http package?

A: The UPnP client needs additional APIs that aren't supported by the standard http
package. I proposed the additional APIs as extensions to the standard http package,
but they were rejected because the http package is being redesigned. So for now I'm
using my own patched copy of the http package. When the standard http package has been
enhanced to support the features that UPnP needs I'll get rid of this patched version.

Current Status

+ Can encode / decode arbitrary bencode data.
+ Can download and parse a torrent file from a URL.
+ Can connect to a tracker and obtain a set of peers.
+ Can create and checksum the files listed in the info map
+ Can use UPnP to acquire a listener port

Development Roadmap

+ Register a listener port to start listening for peer connections
+ Connect to peers and start exchanging file pieces
+ Keep tracker updated so it doesn't forget about us
+ Progress display
+ Handle creating directories in torrent file list
+ Cache torrent file rather than downloading each time.
+ Full UPnP support (need to be able to search for an unused listener port,
  release the listener port when we quit.)
